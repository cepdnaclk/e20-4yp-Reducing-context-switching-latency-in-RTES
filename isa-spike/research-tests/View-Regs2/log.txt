Dump 1 (The "Before" State):

    Window 0 is doing work (x1, x2, x5 are active).

    Window 1 is dead empty (0x00...).

    Meaning: Hardware started cleanly in the default mode.

Dump 2 (The "After" State):

    Window 0 Data is Preserved (Values didn't change).

    Window 1 is ALIVE!

        Look at x2 (Stack Pointer) in Window 1: 0xffffffff80010100.

        It matches Window 0's x2.

        Meaning: Code successfully teleported the stack pointer from the background window to the new foreground window.

    Look at x1 (Return Address) in Window 1: ...8000009e.

        Meaning: The CPU successfully executed a function call (call) inside the new register bank.
